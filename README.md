# data-fitting-and-find-target

The project include two file: a py file and an exe file which is packaged from the py file.

The usage of the exe file: 
 -  first, choose your excel or csv files, which include many point data to fit;
 -  second, click the button and input your target's parameter(e.g. x-coordinate and y-coordinate);
 -  finally, the exe file will try to use many functions to fit the data and choose the best scheme by minimum the error, and find the best choice which is close to the target.

The project has sections which use LLM but do not have API-key. Maybe use your api-key can enable it.

You can use the exe file directly, or use the py file and modify it(if you have py environment).
